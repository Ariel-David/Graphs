# Weigthted-Directed-Graph-OOP
This project represent a weigthted directed graph which mean directional graphs with nodes and edges.

Node - This class implements the interface node_data, and represent a node with a key (vertex).

Edge - This class represent an edge between two nodes with a specific direction.

DGraph - This class implements the graph interface, representing a basic graph that contains edges and verticles.

Graph_Algo - This class implemets graph_algorithms. Contains a set of algorithems and methods that can be performed on a given graph.

Graph_GUI - This class contains methods that can paint a graph to the screen, using StdDraw class and JFrame.
